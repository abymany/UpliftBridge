                                Where possible, we also invite teachers, coaches or community leaders

                                Whenever possible, gifts are tied to a specific purpose – such as exam fees,
                                school supplies, sports shoes or a one-time support for food.
                                Our goal is that you always know <strong>what</strong> you are helping with
                                and, as the platform grows, <strong>how</strong> funds were used through
                                simple updates and thank-you notes.

                                to use your gift in the most helpful way – for example, covering part of the
                                exam fee, buying a smaller but still meaningful item, or combining with
                                other local support. We do not waste or misdirect funds.
