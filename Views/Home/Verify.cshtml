                    How we verify needs on UpliftBridge

                    We keep this human: enough checks for donors to feel safe,
                    without turning someone’s hardship into paperwork hell.

            <h2 class="h5 fw-bold mb-3">Our approach</h2>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Every need is reviewed before it goes live. We look for clear details, realistic goals,
                and respectful tone. When possible, we prefer gifts that can be routed to an institution
                (school, clinic, store, nonprofit) instead of unrestricted cash.
            </p>

                            We have a real way to contact the requester privately (email/phone) and the story passes basic review.
                            This is the default level while we gather more confirmation.

                        <div class="small text-muted">
                            A trusted community contact confirms the situation (for example: teacher, coach, social worker,
                            community leader, clinic staff). This adds real-world accountability.

                            The need is tied to a verified organization or institution (school, nonprofit, clinic, store),
                            and we have supporting confirmation that the request is legitimate.

                        <strong>Important:</strong> Verification is about reducing risk — it’s not a “judgment” on a person.

                        When possible, we ask posters to provide an <strong>official payment link</strong> (school invoice page,
                        clinic bill portal, store checkout link, etc.). This allows donors to fund the real cost directly.

                            If a poster selects <strong>“Prefer donors to pay the institution directly”</strong>,
                            an official payment link is required — because otherwise that promise is meaningless.
                        </li>

                            If no official link exists, the need can still be posted — but it may remain at a lower trust level
                            until stronger verification is available.

                            We do not want random links. We want official, checkable destinations.
